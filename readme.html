<h1>PyAc2d - GPu accelerated library for 2D Visco-Acoustic wave propagation</h1>

<p>PyAc2d is a python library with a set of objects and methods for performing
2D acoustic Wave propagation using the Finite-Difference method.
The stress-velocity Finite-Difference formulation is used, with visco-acoustic
stress-strain relation and dynamic (time-dependent) effective density.
This formulation allows boundary conditions to be created by tapering
the Q-model at the edges, with no special code at the boundaries.
The boundary conditions are shown to be equivalent to the 
Perfectly-Matched-Layer (PML) method.</p>

<p>The core function are written in a Domain Specific Language (DSL) 
called Eps.
Eps is capable of automatic GPU acceleration,
and the same source code can then be used for both CPUs and GPUs.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Clone the repo to a local directory.
